The .zip file uploaded in 2022 had the frontend file with both lines 44-47 and 62-65 live, meaning values from 62-65 were overwriting those in 44-47. This has been rectified in the 2023 upload (i.e. lines 62-65 are now commented out).

The NEOCARBSULF_means.mat file contains the main results - the outputted means - of the 5,000 model runs for O2, CO2, SO4, d34S and fpyr
